### About
Picoware leverages the [PicoGUI](https://github.com/jblanked/PicoGUI), [pico-game-engine](https://github.com/jblanked/pico-game-engine), and [FlipperHTTP](https://github.com/jblanked/FlipperHTTP/) libraries to bring an "operating system"-like firmware to Raspberry Pi Pico devices. It is in the beginning stages and is open to contributions from developers.
